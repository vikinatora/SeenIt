        <h1>Who am I</h1>
        <p>
            I'm a 20 year old application developer in Sofia. I study Informatics and Software Engineering at Technical Univerity of
            Sofia. I'm born in Sliven but I live in Sofia where I currently work and study. In my free time I like to read books about
            self improvement, go to the gym and improve my skills in League of Legends when I have nothing else to do. I'm also interested
            in psychology but programming took the edge over it.
